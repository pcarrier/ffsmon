Ruleset
- Velcro beats shoelaces hands down. Avoid sophistication.
- Hardware is cheap. Do everything at least twice, then de-duplicate.
- Don't reinvent the wheel, use hexagons.
  If someone did good enough, don't do perfect.
  Writing and maintaining is far from perfect.
- Programs are bombs. Do controlled explosions.
- Unit tests are for wuss. Record. Refactor. Replay.

Golden rule: LEAVE IT OUT!
- Configuration? OUT! We have puppet. Maybe revisit.
- Data collection? OUT! collectd does great. Integrate. Maybe revisit.
- Node classificant? OUT! We have inventory, DNS, etc. Integrate. Maybe revisit.
- Texting, calling, escalating? OUT! Pagerduty seems cool. Integrate. Maybe revisit.
- A problem to solve that's not only yours?
  Give it to someone else. They'll solve it for everyone.
